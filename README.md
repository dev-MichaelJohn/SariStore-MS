## 🤔 Why SariStore MS


Sari-sari stores are a **vital part of neighborhoods in the Philippines**. However, as vital as they are, these Sari-sari stores often face **problems that can disrupt their daily operations**, or worse, **lead to closure**. Many small stores struggle to keep up with **manual management of sales, inventory, and customer credit**. As the world shifts toward **digital solutions**, **SariStore MS** helps by providing:


* Faster and more accurate transactions
* Automatic tracking of inventory and low-stock alerts
* Simple management of customer credit (utang)
* Quick insights into store performance through reports

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* This is a **personal project** built to practice new technologies (Neovim, TypeScript, Svelte, Drizzle ORM), prepare for my **Capstone thesis**, and potentially **contribute to the community**.  
* Due to limited experience with UI/UX design, full mobile responsiveness may be implemented in later stages.
* Offline operation and migrating to SQLite for local usage will be considered if time allows.
* Some features are MVP, while others are planned stretch goals—expect this project to evolve over time.
* **Feedback, suggestions, or even a friendly hello are always welcome!**
